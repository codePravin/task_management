Phase 1: Before MIT 6.005
To start 6.005 confidently, you need to be comfortable with Java fundamentals and core language features.

✅ Topics to Learn Before Starting MIT 6.005
Topic	Description
🧠 Java Basics	Variables, data types, conditionals (if, switch), loops (for, while)
🧰 Functions/Methods	Defining methods, parameters, return values, method overloading
📦 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)	Classes, objects, constructors, this, getters/setters
🏗️ Encapsulation	Access modifiers (private, public, protected)
🧬 Inheritance & Polymorphism	extends, super, method overriding, dynamic dispatch
🔤 Interfaces & Abstract Classes	interface, abstract, implementing multiple interfaces
📚 Java Collections	ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, basic iteration (for-each)
🎯 Basic Exception Handling	try-catch, finally, throw, throws
🛠️ Java Compilation + Execution	How javac and java work, classpath, packages
💻 Using an IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse)	Creating projects, running, debugging, managing files
🧪 Basic Testing	Simple JUnit or console-based validation of logic

🧠 Recommended Resource to Learn All This:
✅ Java Programming MOOC by University of Helsinki — One of the best beginner-to-intermediate Java courses (free and deep)

✅ Or JetBrains Academy Java Developer track (if you prefer interactive learning)

🎓 Phase 2: After MIT 6.005
Once you've done 6.005, you’ll be strong in clean code, modularity, testing, and concurrent programming. Now, it's time to become a Java master by diving deeper into advanced topics and Java 8+ features.

🔥 Topics to Learn After MIT 6.005 for Java Mastery
Topic	Description
💡 Java 8+ Functional Features	Lambdas, method references, streams, Optional
📦 Streams API	map(), filter(), collect(), chaining operations
📄 Java File I/O & NIO	Reading/writing files, directories, using java.nio package
📋 Serialization	Serializable, custom serialization, JSON libraries (Gson, Jackson)
🧵 Advanced Concurrency	ExecutorService, CompletableFuture, ForkJoinPool
🔐 Multithreading + Locks	synchronized, ReentrantLock, race conditions, deadlock
🧪 JUnit 5 & Mockito	Advanced testing, mocking dependencies, test coverage
📦 Maven / Gradle	Build tools, managing dependencies
🧱 Java Modules (JPMS)	Modularizing apps (module-info.java)
♻️ Garbage Collection + JVM Tuning	Heap, GC types, memory leaks
🎯 Design Patterns in Java	Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.
🧰 Spring Boot (for web/enterprise dev)	Popular framework for building production apps

🧱 Optional (For Deep System Understanding)
Topic	Why It Helps
🧠 JVM Internals	Learn how Java runs (bytecode, class loading, memory model)
🔍 Java Bytecode & Class Files	Understanding how Java is compiled and run
🔧 Performance Profiling & Tuning	Java VisualVM, jconsole, etc.
